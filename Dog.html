    <p>Once you have your doggy treat, get your dog's attention by showing that you have a yummy treat.</p>

    <p>As you can see, I definitely have her attention now by showing her what's in my hand.</p>
    <h2 id="third-step">Step 3</h2>
    <p>Okay, now here is the important part.<br>You need to let your dog earn the treat. You cannot give them the treat because they want it solely. Tell them to do a trick or to walk around with you.<br>Watch below for a demonstration.</p>

    <p>Now your dog should have some energy and will be excited for the next treat!<br>As you can see, my dog just eats on the ground and will go back to being lazy. I guess I'm not the best teacher at showing how to do this after all...</p>
